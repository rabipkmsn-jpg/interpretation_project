# 🩺 Clinical Diagnosis Prediction from Patient Records using BERT

## Introduction
With the rapid growth of electronic health records (EHRs), a large amount of unstructured clinical text is generated daily. Extracting meaningful insights from these records can assist healthcare professionals in decision-making. This project focuses on leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques to predict possible medical diagnoses from patient clinical notes.

---

## Project Description
This project implements a **BERT-based multi-class classification system** to predict medical diagnoses from clinical notes. The system processes raw patient records, cleans and tokenizes the text, and trains a BERT model from scratch to learn contextual representations. The trained model can then predict the most likely diagnosis for unseen patient records.

The complete pipeline includes:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Custom tokenizer training
- Model training and evaluation
- Model saving and deployment for inference

---

## Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
- To preprocess and normalize unstructured clinical notes
- To convert clinical text into model-readable token sequences
- To train a BERT-based model to predict patient diagnoses
- To evaluate the model using standard classification metrics
- To build a reusable prediction pipeline for real-world inference

---

## Workflow
1. **Prepare and Clean the Data**
   - Lowercasing text
   - Removing numbers, punctuation, and stopwords
2. **Tokenization**
   - Train a custom WordPiece tokenizer on clinical notes
3. **Model Training**
   - Train a BERT model from scratch for diagnosis prediction
4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report
   - Accuracy and F1 Score
5. **Deployment**
   - Save trained model, tokenizer, and label encoder
   - Build a prediction function for new patient records

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries & Frameworks:**
  - PyTorch
  - Hugging Face Transformers
  - Tokenizers
  - Scikit-learn
  - Pandas & NumPy
  - NLTK
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn
- **Model Architecture:** BERT (Transformer-based)
- **Hardware Support:** GPU (CUDA) with mixed precision (FP16)

---

## Blockers / Hurdles Faced
- **Training BERT from Scratch:**  
  Training without pretrained weights required careful tuning of learning rate, warmup steps, and epochs.
- **Data Leakage Risk:**  
  Ensuring that diagnosis labels did not trivially appear in clinical notes required strict preprocessing.
- **Class Imbalance:**  
  Some diagnoses appeared less frequently, affecting prediction performance.
- **High Computational Cost:**  
  Long sequences and large model size required gradient checkpointing and mixed precision training.

## Achievements
- Successfully built a complete end-to-end NLP pipeline for clinical diagnosis prediction
- Trained a BERT-based classifier capable of handling long clinical notes
- Achieved meaningful performance evaluated through accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrix
- Implemented a reusable inference pipeline for real-time predictions
- Saved and packaged the trained model for deployment

---

## Future Scope
- Fine-tuning pretrained clinical language models (e.g., BioBERT, ClinicalBERT)
- Incorporating attention-based explanation techniques for interpretability
- Expanding the dataset to include more diagnoses
- Deploying the model as a web or API-based service
- Integrating confidence scores for safer medical decision support
