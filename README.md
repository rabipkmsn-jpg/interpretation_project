# MEDPREDICT - Diagnosis Prediction from Clinical Notes using BERT 

This project implements a BERT-based model to predict potential medical diagnoses from clinical notes and patient histories. It leverages the `bert-base-cased` pre-trained model and fine-tunes it for multi-class classification.  

---

## Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Cleans text data and prepares it for modeling.  
- **Tokenization:** Converts text into tokens compatible with BERT using `BertTokenizer`.  
- **Fine-tuning BERT:** Adapts the pre-trained BERT model for multi-class diagnosis prediction.  
- **Model Evaluation:** Assesses performance using a confusion matrix and classification report.  
- **Model Saving & Deployment:** Saves the trained model and tokenizer for future predictions.

## Evaluation
The model performance can be evaluated using:
- **Confusion Matrix** – to visualize classification results.
- **Classification Report** – to assess precision, recall, and F1-score.
